The main code is contained in the file Thesis.m, while the function for experiments is in Experiment.m. The parameters specified in the file are those for the baseline simulation. 
The results are stored in Results.xlsx and figures can be obtained by running the code in Figures.m, using these results. 
In order to replicate the data in Results.xlsx, the changes to be done are listed below. These changes are with respect to the ones done in the step before.
